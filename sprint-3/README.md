**Intended Design**
By using Angular Frontend Framework and HTTPClient calls to the Augur interface, we implemented a user-friendly frontend view of the data it contains, including a navigation bar and visuals of multiple metrics within repoitories. Users can view the different calculated metrics of committers, pull rates, and repository issues for each chosen repository of the Augur database in table and pie chart formats.

In addition, we were able to successfully set up our site to run off of a Firebase server, if users choose not to run the project locally.

**Goals For Sprint 3**
  Between Sprint 2 and Sprint 3, our group tranistioned from a Full Stack team to a Front End team. As such, our goals were changed and updated: 
  
- Integrate New Firebase Server and Database
- Display data
   - Front End:
     - https://github.com/computationalmystic/sengfs19-group12/tree/master/frontend
- Implement calls and visualisations on site
  - Top 10 Commiters
    - List Of Names
    - Pie Chart Comparing Top Committers 
  - Pulls and Pull acceptance rates of success/failures
 
  - List of Repositories and Repository Issues


**Future Design Goals**
  - Search for any bugs in site.
  - Fine tune any errors or oddities. 
  - Make visually more appealing.
