### Transitioning to Front End
After Sprint 2, it was decided that we would be a Front End group rather than a Full Stack group. We decided as a team to look over the new requirements for front end work and we decided how we would split this up and decide to build off of our already existing work. From our previous submission of Sprint 2, we had originally decided to make API calls to Augur and store the data retrieved into our Firebase database retrieve that data on our UI. In transitioning to front end work, we decided to keep our front end work all the focus and pull in data within javascript to make our API calls.

### Intended Design
From our previous work in Sprint 2, we already had one UI prepared with a visualization of each repositories top committers. For our other 2 front end pages, we decided to continue with our original plan of making API calls and split those into our 2 separate front end pages. For one of our new front end pages, we made API calls to retrieve data regarding pull acceptance rate and displayed it using a line chart. For the other new front end page, we used API calls to retrieve data that showed issues that appeared when pushing data to repositories and the date they occurred shown on a bar graph.

In addition, we decided to make our home page more user friendly with a stronger front end focus, and we also included extra tabs about the team and about us and our work with Augur.
