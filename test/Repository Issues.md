# Repository Issues 

Designed to illustrate number of issues in repositories. 


(After selecting & navigating to page)

    1. Select   
    "Click Me First To Retrieve Data From API"
    
    2. Wait a few moments for 1st dropdown to load.
    
    3. Select a repository from the first "Project List" dropdown.  
      ex  "Rails (wg-value)"
      
    4. Wait a few moments for 2nd dropdown to load.
    
    5. Select from dropdown.  
      ex  "rails"
      
    6. Select  
      "Get Information"  
      
    7. Bar Graph should appear in field below.  
    Also, if mouse is hovered along graph, a bubble appears making data easily readable.  
    ex: Rails-rails had 35 issues on 2013-03-04  
![Rails-rails as of Dec 9,2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/computationalmystic/sengfs19-group12/master/test/Issues%20rail%20rails.png)

Issues may arise from one allowing time for either drop down to load.
Also, if data is not available, field will disply an error:  
    Data column(s) for axis #0 cannot be of type string  
Graphs are from data collected at time of calls & example figures won't neccessarily stay accurate over time. 

      		Note:  
			To properly use site, shield in Navagation bar may need to be deactived.  
			Please allow "Load Unsafe Scripts".
