# Learn More About Augur

This was set up to give users the opportunity to visit Augur information page and learn what type of data we are retrieving and where our API endpoints are from. 

This link should lead to  
  http://augur.osshealth.io/api_docs/
  
  Issues that may arise because it is completely dependent on an outside source to update and maintain the page .  If the Augur health document gets removed or relocated, this link will need to be updated.
